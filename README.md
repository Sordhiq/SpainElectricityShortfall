# SpainElectricityShortfall

There is evidence that the reliance on purely non-renewable fossil-fuel energy sources is unsustainable. Transitioning into renewable energy sources is simply inevitable.
By analyzing the effect of different weather features with time on energy supplied, this project is aimed helping the Spanish government predict future energy deficit from renewable resources and leverage data-driven solutions to model shortfall between the energy produced by fossil fuels and proffer sustainable renewable alternatives so as to accommodate for deficits in the power grid.
